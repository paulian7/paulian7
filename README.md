## Hello hello! 👋 

My name is Paulian Le and I am a first generation student majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. 

- 💭  I have big dreams of one day inspiring young girls and individuals from underrepresented communities to pursue their very own passions in the tech industry as well.
- ✨  As to what I am interested in, I love web development and currently exploring the world of robotics and UI/UX design.
- 🌱  I am currently improving my skills in C++, JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, Git/Github. On the other hand, I am learning React.
