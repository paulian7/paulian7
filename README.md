## 👋 Hello hello! 

My name is Paulian (Paul-Lee-Anne), and I recently earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside. 

I am passionate about pursuing new grad or internship roles in software engineering, especially those that drive positive change and make an impact on a broad audience. 

To learn more about me, please check out my LinkedIn profile!

## 💭 Outside of Tech...

I’m a huge movie fanatic! Ask me what my favorite film is, and I’ll tell you all about it. :) I am also trying my hand at gouache painting. So, if you have any tips with gouache painting, please feel free to tell me some!

Other hobbies, however, include cafe hopping, finding the best matcha recipe, journaling, and occasionally bouldering.
