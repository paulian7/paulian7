## 👋 Hello hello! 

My name is Paulian (Paul-Lee-Anne), and I recently earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside. 

I am passionate about pursuing new grad or internship roles in software engineering, especially those that drive positive change and make an impact on a broad audience.

I’m a huge movie fanatic! Ask me what my favorite film is, and I’ll tell you all about it. :) I also love to run as well. Hope to run day run the New York City Marathon one day! :) 

Other hobbies, however, include cafe hopping, finding the best matcha recipe, and reading.
