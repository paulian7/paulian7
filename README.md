## 👋 Hello hello! 

My name is Paulian (Paul-Lee-Anne), and I am currently a first generation student majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. 

## 💭 Dreams and aspirations...
- I am currently chasing my dreams of combining my love for tech and the entertainment industry. My biggest dream would be to work for Pixar.
  
- But above all, I hope to one day inspire young girls and individuals from underrepresented communities to pursue their very own passions in the tech industry as well. 
  
## 🎞️ Who am I outside of tech...
- I love bouldering, skateboarding, visiting national parks, and watching films/shows.
  
- My favorite film currently is "La La Land". 🎵
