## 👋 Hello hello! 

My name is Paulian (Paul-Lee-Anne), and I am a first generation Computer Science New Grad from the University of California, Riverside. I am currently interested in opportunities related to software engineering. I do have a very keen interest in front-end engineering though! 

## 💭 Dreams and aspirations...

- I am currently chasing my dreams of combining my love for tech and entertainment industry. I would love to work in a job where I can make an impact on a large group of individuals. 
  
## 🎞️ Who am I outside of tech...
- I am currently trying my hand gouache painting - so, if you have any tips, please let me know! My other hobbies include watching films, cafe hopping, practicing the guitar, journaling, and occassionally bouldering.
  
- My favorite film of all time has to be "La La Land". 🎵
