## 👋 Hello hello! 

My name is **Paulian** *(Paul-Lee-Ann)* and I am a first generation student majoring in **Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside**. 

- 💭  I have dreams of one day combining my love for tech and wildlife. But above all, I hope to one day inspire young girls and individuals from underrepresented communities to pursue their very own passions in the tech industry as well. 
- 💡  As to what I am currently interested in, I love web development and I am exploring the world of UI/UX design.
- 🌱  I am at the moment improving my skills in C/C++, JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, Python, Git/GitHub. On the other hand, I am learning React.
