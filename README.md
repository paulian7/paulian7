## 👋 Hey! I'm Paulian!

I graduated in June 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside.  
I'm passionate about building technology that drives positive change and reaches wide audiences.  

Feel free to peruse my profile! You'll find projects I've been working on - from research web apps to personal projects.  

## 🎥 Outside of Tech...

I’m a huge movie fanatic! *La La Land* has to be one of my favorite — it’s a beautiful ode to movies, filled with nods to countless classics.
